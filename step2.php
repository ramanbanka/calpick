				First settled in the middle of the 19th century, its first post office opened in 1864 under the name Sévigné, perhaps in honour of the Marquise de Sévigné (1626-1696). From 1876 to 1884, the post office was known as Hartwell, and from 1884 on, it became Chénéville. It could be that it was renamed in memory of a nephew of Hercule Chéné who was born around 1864.[4] (Pierre Hercule Chéné (1834-1904) was mayor of Ripon-et-Hartwell, Hartwell-et-Suffolk, Hartwell, and Hartwell-et-Preston, and counselor of Chénéville.[5])

				In 1903, the village separated from the United Township Municipality of Hartwell-et-Preston to form the Village Municipality of Chénéville, following a request from 55 citizens submitted to the Lieutenant Governor.[4] Hygin Locas was its first mayor. At that time, the village consisted of 26 homes and 6 streets.[5]

				The Vinoy Post Office opened in 1871, most likely named in honour of the French General Joseph Vinoy (1800-1880). In 1920, the western portion of Suffolk Township separated and formed the Township Municipality of Suffolk-West, but was renamed Vinoy three years later. On August 21, 1996, the Vinoy merged to Chénéville and they formed the new Municipality of Chénéville.[4]
